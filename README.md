# E-Commerce WebdriverIO Project

This project is an automation suite for testing e-commerce website functionalities using [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/), a robust browser and mobile automation framework for Node.js.

## Project Structure

The repository comprises the following key files:

- **`package.json`**: Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies and scripts.
- **`wdio.conf.js`**: Configuration file for WebdriverIO, specifying test settings and capabilities.
- **`.gitignore`**: Lists files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as `node_modules/` and logs.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the tests locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulsingh731/E-Commerce-WebdriverIO.git
   cd E-Commerce-WebdriverIO
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure WebdriverIO**:

   Review and adjust the `wdio.conf.js` file to match your testing environment and requirements.

4. **Run Tests**:

   Execute the test suite using:

   ```bash
   npx wdio run wdio.conf.js
   ```

## Writing Tests

Tests are written using WebdriverIO's syntax, allowing for both synchronous and asynchronous commands. Refer to the [WebdriverIO documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted) for detailed guidance on writing and organizing tests.

## Reporting

The project can be configured to generate test reports using various reporters supported by WebdriverIO, such as the [Allure Reporter](https://webdriver.io/docs/allure-reporter/). Ensure the necessary plugins are installed and configured in the `wdio.conf.js` file.
